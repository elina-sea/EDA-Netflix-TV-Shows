This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Part 1

  This is an R Notebook containing the analysis of different parameters of set of 240 stars. Data set was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/deepu1109/star-dataset).
  Stars are divided into the following 6 classes:

  - Brown Dwarf -> Star Type = 0
  - Red Dwarf -> Star Type = 1
  - White Dwarf-> Star Type = 2
  - Main Sequence -> Star Type = 3
  - Supergiant -> Star Type = 4
  - Hypergiant -> Star Type = 5
  
  Let's start with observing what types of variables there are in this data set:

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
#read in the dataset
stars <- read_csv("Stars.csv")
```

  As we can observe from this data set has majorly quantitative variables: `temperature measured in Kelvins, luminosity (with respect to Sun), radius (with respect to Sun), absolute visual magnitude, star type` and minorly of qualitative variables: `star color, spectral class`.
  
#### Reasoning for using this data set
  Some of the tasks to be performed and aspects to be explored:
  
### Analysing missing values 

```{r message = FALSE}
library(VIM)
library(naniar)
library(ggplot2)
#plot missing values with naniar pkg which is based on ggplot2
gg_miss_var(stars)
#plot proportions of missing values and their combos with vim aggr 
summary(aggr(stars))
```

  As we can see, there are no missing values in this data set. Which means we can assume that all relations will be reliable.
  
```{r}
#stars <- c(stars$type)

```
